Under macOS 10.15.4 Catalina the following trackpad inputs produce CGEvents of this type:

trackpad input      type

2 finger swipe      29, 22 (in tandem)
3 finger swipe      29, 30 (in tandem)

2 finger pinch      29
4 finger pinch      29, 30 (in tandem)

rotate              I forgot
force touch         I forgot
double tap          29 (iirc)






22: NSEventTypeScrollWheel
29: NSEventTypeGesture
30: NSEventTypeMagnify, but that doesn't make sense?


Weirdly aren't used:
NSEventTypeSwipe
NSEventTypeRotate
NSEventTypeSmartMagnify
NSEventTypePressure
NSEventTypeQuickLook

-> Maybe these types are only used for NSEvents not for CGEvents
